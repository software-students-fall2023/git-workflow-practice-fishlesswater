# Things I find interesting
What I find particularly interesting about GitHub Copilot and its impact on the software engineering industry is its influences on future programming careers for software engineers. Copilot showcases the potential of AI to assist and enhance the work of software engineers by automating routine coding tasks, suggesting solutions, and debugging. As AI continues to advance, it challenges professionals by requiring deeper understandings of architecture and reducing the role of software coders and testers lacking comprehensive business and technical acumen

I liked this article because it highlighted how the jobs for developers will not necessarily disappear, but will change the necessary skillset. This article makes it clear that architecture and code design will become more important, as AI will be able to handle many bug fixes and code implementation.
